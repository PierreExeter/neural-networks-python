# Neural networks from scratch in Python

In these series of tutorials, we will learn how to implement simple artifical neural network in Python.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 1. Single Layer Perceptron

Implementation of a simple neural network in pure Numpy. Please refer to [this article](https://www.datasparked.com/deep%20learning/Implement-a-neural-network-in-Python/) for more details.
